# Bird's Eye View
UCF Senior Design 2017-18

## Description
Take a folder that contains photos of birds and other stuff, get a folder of just birds, no other stuff.

### Training Dataset
To ensure accuracy of the training model, we gathered a training dataset of large, high-resolution images. The set is divided into two classifications: bird and not_bird. File names of images that contain birds will begin with `00`, and those without birds will begin with `10`.
